# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I learnt some principles of Object Oriented Programming.

Focused on the Single Responsibility Principle, but I was exposed to other SOLID principles.

Ended the day by solving some challenges on codewars

### Day 2: January 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
I learnt the other principles of Object Oriented Programming (SOLID Principles)

Open/Closed Principle
Liskov Substitution Principle
Interface Segregation Principle and
Dependency Inversion Principle

I'll be coding a Todo list app tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 3, 2021

Todo List App:
I can't design so I searched dribbble for inspirations, found one I like and emailed the designer for permission to use it in my app.

While I await the designer's reply, I set up some development tools and took time to write and understand some webpack configurations rather than just copy/pasting

**Thoughts:**
Beginner frontend developers should learn to use some design tools, it'll help a lot.

### Day 4: January 4, 2021

I'm still yet to get a design for my app. I've started coding the main logic for the project. I'll write the UI updating code when I have a UI Smiling face with open mouth and cold sweat

Fixed some bugs in my webpack
config. Also learnt some coding styles (esp AirBnB style guide) and linting

### Day 5: January 5, 2021

Todo list app:
Finally got a design, I've written some of the markup and some styling to see how the final app would look like.

Most of the HTML code would later be dynamically generated via JavaScript.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
